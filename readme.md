Welcome!

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 53, theme "Delivery." Made with Godot 4.0.2. 

The meat of the game is within the `SolarSystem.tscn` scene. You'll find the bulk of the items within there, including managers for the various mechanics of the game. Pretty much anything outside of that is going to be the basic menus.

Also, you'll probably find dangling bits of code or strange decisions. Just... feel free to ignore them. They were ideas that never made it any further.

Enjoy!
